## Context and Features

Hello, and welcome to the Poster Project! My partner Michael and I were assigned this project on Tuesday, March 29, 2022. In our time working on this project, we were able to complete three iterations of our site. This basic web-page allows one to randomly generate motivational posters including a title, quote, and image. When visiting the page, the user is automatically met with a randomly generated poster. The web-page also allows the user to save posters that they like, and create their very own poster by providing an image url, motivational title, and motivational quote. Though this page may appear relatively simple, there are a lot of moving pieces going on behind the scenes for the functionality of our web page. We learned many different skills over the course of this project, and incorporated said skills into the creation of the project. We hope that it provides you with some much needed joy, and of course motivation.

## Lessons Learned

My partner and I had to incorporate a great amount of prior knowledge, and learn some new JavaScript concepts in order for us to get our page running how we wanted it to. This project required extensive use of DOM query selectors, event listeners, and functions. It also required a class, a loop, and a conditional. Our initial goal was to complete iteration 3 of our project. We did attain this goal, but unfortunately didnâ€™t reach our stretch goal of iteration 4. Many aspects of this project were challenging for us both including managing the amount of query selected data, creating functions that would make use of multiple methods, and keeping our event selectors performing the tasks we wanted them to. My partner and I worked together, but also consulted our colleagues, and mentors for some additional assistance when we needed it. The result is a collaborative effort that we are both proud of.

## Future Features

Some future features we'd like to add to this application are:

- Only saving one instance of a poster to the saved poster's page.
- Being able to delete posters from the saved poster's page.
- Having saved posters persist across page refreshes using local storage.

## Application Set-Up

1. Fork repository on GitHub.

2. `Git clone` the repository to your local machine.

3. `Cd` into the directory.

4. Run `open index.html` in your terminal.
